# DeepFakeDefenders
### The Nth Room incident in South Korea has raised awareness about the dangers of deepfakes in society. Inclusionãƒ»The Global Multimedia Deepfake Detection encourages participants to open source their model codes, helping more people detect video forgeries and combat the malicious use of deepfake technology, paving the way for AI to serve the greater good.

We call on participants to release their own detection code on github and name their own repository DeepFakeDefenders. We will organize all the open source repositories on our github home page.
