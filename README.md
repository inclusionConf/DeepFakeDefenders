# DeepFakeDefenders
### Deepfake technology can easily create false videos, images, and audio, making it difficult for the public to distinguish between what is real and what is fake. This poses risks to society, such as information security, telecom fraud, and the spread of rumors.
Inclusionãƒ»The Global Multimedia Deepfake Detection encourages participants to open source their model codes, helping more people detect video forgeries and combat the malicious use of deepfake technology, paving the way for AI to serve the greater good.

We call on participants to release your own detection code on github and name your own repository DeepFakeDefenders. We will organize all the open source repositories on our github home page.

Any participant has already released your deepfake detection code can feedback in the issue and we'll update it to the home page.
